## 🚀 Major Enhancements (v1.1.0)

### 1. Partner Preferences System

**What it does:**
- Import Excel files with partner-specified manager assignments
- Automatically match clients/groups to preferences
- Lock matched clients to prevent re-allocation
- Provide detailed summary of matches and mismatches

**Files Added:**
- `src/partner-preferences.js` - Core logic for import and application

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/preferences/import` - Import preference file
- `POST /api/clients/:id/unlock` - Unlock specific client
- `PATCH /api/clients/:id/lock` - Lock/unlock client

**User Benefits:**
- Respect partner-client relationships
- Maintain critical assignments
- Reduce manual corrections
- Balance remaining workload automatically

### 2. Client Locking System

**What it does:**
- Visual lock indicator (🔒) on client cards
- Click to toggle lock status
- Locked clients excluded from allocation
- Lock status persists across sessions

**Implementation:**
- Lock property added to client objects
- UI visual feedback with lock icons
- API endpoints for lock management
- Allocation algorithm respects locks

### 3. Search Functionality

**What it does:**
- Real-time client filtering
- Search by client name, partner, or group
- Two-pass algorithm handles group headers
- Clear visual feedback

**Implementation:**
- Search input in allocation board
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles both individual and group cards
- Preserves drag-and-drop functionality

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

**Centralized Constants:**
- Created `src/constants.js`
- Single source of truth for `MONTH_NAMES`
- Helper function `createMonthObject()`
- Eliminates duplication across 5+ files
- Follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

## 🎓 Algorithm Details

### Allocation Algorithm (allocate.js)

**Steps:**
1. Filter out locked clients (new in v1.1)
2. Calculate monthly targets (total hours / # managers)
3. Separate groups and individuals
4. Sort groups by total hours (largest first)
5. For each group:
   - Calculate cost for each manager
   - Select manager with lowest cost
   - Check capacity constraints
   - Assign all group members
6. Sort individuals by hours (largest first)
7. Repeat assignment process for individuals
8. Fall back to least-overcapacity manager if needed

**Cost Function:**
```
Cost = Σ(projected_load - target)² for each month
```

This squared deviation ensures balanced monthly distribution.
